Going through Chris Hayes' "[Python with Stanford Alpaca and Vicuna 13B AI models - A llama-cpp-python Tutorial!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BidzsQYZM4)"

- Note: the url where Chris got his model says "obsolete", so I searched HuggingFace and found (as of 2023-Nov-21) [a different file named `ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit-rev1.bin`](https://huggingface.co/Bleak/ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit-rev1/tree/main)
